## Objective

Malaysia is currently struggling to deal with the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. This analysis aims to highlight a few data points that illuminate the response so far of the government, and where additional investment may be required. 

 1. Test positivity rate, and the need to perform more testing
 2. Changes in mobility, related to the positivity rate
 
## Test positivity rate

The test positivity rate is still quite elevated in Malaysia, above the minimum threshold recommended by the WHO (5%), and especially high compared to a successful country in managing Covid-19, South Korea. The following charts depict the evolution of number of new cases, number of tests, and positivity rate. All data is 7-day smoothed (rolling average); people tested are per 1,000 population; new daily cases are per million population.
