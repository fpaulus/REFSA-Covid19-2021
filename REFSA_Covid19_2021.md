This tracker brings together a number of oft-referred to statistics to monitor the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic in Malaysia, and highlight some interesting data points. As of now, the following data is included: 

 1. Daily count of tests, cases and test positivity rate
 2. Mobility data, based on Google's Covid-19 location data
 
## Tests, cases and positivity rate

## Mobility

Analysis of mobility is based on Google's data for Malaysia. 
The charts below show the percent change compared to a baseline. The baseline is the median number of daily routing requests between early January to early February 2020. 



### Change from baseline across categories

This chart shows the change in destinations relative to a pre-pandemic baseline, smoothed using a 7-day rolling average. Each time movement restrictions are announced, there is a noticeable drop in retail and recreation destinations as well as transit stations.

The effect of the resumption of interstate travel on 2020-12-07 is well visible in the "Transit Stations" category. From that day there is a clear uptick in the number of requests for transit stations. Looking at that chart in isolation:

For further analysis, we could look to include economic data (high frequency indicators would be best), and relate that to the evolution of the pandemic and the mobility data.
